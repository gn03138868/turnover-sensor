It is a prototype of root turnover sensor.

Step 1. operate Tif_JPGE.py to transfer tif images to jpg images

Step 2. operate align_images_ECC.py to align images for further steps

Step 3. operate ECC_fitting.py to calculate the root increment and decrement by the output of post-process images from ARATA

# The higher accuracy the output from ARATA, the higher accuracy the turnover of roots represented.
